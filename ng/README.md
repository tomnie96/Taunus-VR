## Aframe
* Integrated into Angular following https://medium.com/@pitipon/a-frame-with-angular-setup-project-5797b2f2a03b
* Integrate further A-Frame Features: https://rasor.github.io/dependency-management-in-angular-cli-lib-a-frame.html

## Scopes
* Aframe as well as Angular Components use `this`
* `this` within `AFRAME.registerComponent` refers to the Aframe component
* Therefore, `context` is introduced. It points from Aframe components to the Angular component
* Additionally, the `this` context gets lost when calling async methods. Therefore, `self` is used in these cases.
